# itsnicethat-feed

This is a hacked-together JSON feed generator (basically a fork of [`atlas-feed`](https://github.com/lukasschwab/atlas-feed)) for [It's Nice That](https://www.itsnicethat.com/); it na√Øvely processes their HTML, so I expect it to break eventually.

## Resources

+ [The main feed is live here.](https://itsnicethat-feed-dot-arxiv-feeds.appspot.com/)
+ Supports feeds for tags, e.g. [Bookshelf](https://itsnicethat-feed-dot-arxiv-feeds.appspot.com/bookshelf).
